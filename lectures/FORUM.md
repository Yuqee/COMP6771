# Forum etiquette

## 1. Check to see if your problem has already been asked

Many students have the same questions, so it's best to see if your problem is already being triaged.
Your situation might feel unique, but there's a high chance that it's similar enough to someone
else's problem that you should at least consider questions asked in the last two days.

This reduces the amount of volume that you'll see on the forums, and will also let us teaching staff
pour more time into producing high-quality content.

## 2. If you do ask, please give a detailed write up of your situation

Many questions often say "I did a thing and it didn't work". This doesn't give us any information,
and so we can't help you work out how to get past the problem. Some also post a snippet of the
information, but not quite enough to get us to a point where we're actually able to help.

### 2.1. Saying hello

Many of your classmates and teachers are not guys; you may want to consider using more inclusive
language (e.g. "folks", "everyone", or just dropping the word altogether).

### 2.2. Provide a descriptive title

Titles help both us and and your peers work out what your problem is. Short titles like "ranges" or
"test case" are very general, and make it difficult to work out both what your problem is, and to
find your problem at a later date. Good titles will also help you track down previously-asked
questions.

Instead, consider "Trouble including header &lt;range&gt;", which tells us _exactly_ what your problem is.
For something like "test case", perhaps "Do we need to submit our own tests?".

### 2.3. Technical help

When posting a question about a tute/assignment, please make sure that your posts have the following
information in them:

1. Which system you're building on (VLAB, Remote SSH, or at home). If you're building at home,
   please identify your host operating system and if you're running on natively, or if you're using
   WSL2/WSL/Docker/a VM.
2. Whether you're building using VS Code, another editor, or via the command line. Please provide
   detailed steps of _what you've done_ in all three cases. For example, if you're following our
   example and are using VS Code, you might say "I ran _CMake Configure_ and _CMake Build_, and
   that's when the errors started happening".
3. Tell us which file(s) you're trying to build.
4. Tell us what you're trying to do.
5. Post the build rule for those files, preferably as text. Posting as an image is fine, but it
   makes it much harder for us to search for known phrases. You can turn the message into code font
   by wrapping the code in ``` on a line above and a line below the message in Markdown mode.
6. Post the full diagnostic (error), preferably as text, for the same reasons.
7. If you're getting a diagnostic for your code, please paste some of the code for context. If it's
   a tute question that you're having difficulties with, you can make the post public. If it's for
   an assignment and you need to post more than a line or two for context, please make the question
   private.

### 2.4. Lecture help

Lecture help is often related to slides, and it's been observed that these questions are usually
articulated quite well, but sometimes lack slide numbers. Please provide the slide number in the
bottom-right corner of the slide (this is for both the web-based and PDF slides).
